<script type="text/html" data-help-name="mapper">
    <p>Node to map the contents of a message property from one value to another.</p>
    <p>The message property is compared against each of the values in the left-hand column
       and if there is a match, it is changed to the value in the right-hand column.</p>
    <p>By default, the <b>msg.payload</b> is the property that is operated on, but this 
       can be changed to other properties, such as the topic name.</p>
    <p>If the message does not match any of the values in the mapping, the message can 
       either be ignored or passed through unmodified.</p>
